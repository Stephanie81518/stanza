# Stanza<br>
## Summary<br>
Stanza was created out of the belief that poetry has the power to enrich lives. Our application was designed with a range of users in mind, so that writers of any skill level will find a use for Stanza. For beginners, Stanza functions as an educational tool, while for more experienced writers it serves as a tool for organization and inspiration. Our hope is that Stanza will open users up to exploring the world of poetry while helping them connect to their own creative potential.

Stanza is a web application built for creative writers. Stanza features a fully-functional rich text editor that allows users to compose work that can be saved to the application and retrieved later for editing--alongside API-powered tools that provide valuable inspiration and guidance while users shape their poems.

Use Stanza to create new poems, and log in to save and edit your work. Our 'Home' page allows you to choose from several major poetic forms to experiment with; for each form, you'll find a short guide to the form's conventions alongside examples of published poems for you to read and reference. Let our 'Word Explorer' tool help get you unstuck, or encourage you to experiment.

We hope our website inspires you to begin your journey on a path of poetry appreciation. And remember: it's okay to deviate from the guidelines; your poems might even be better for it.

## Features<br>
A proprietary, in-app text editor, designed specifically to assist users in writing poems, provides word assistance and counts syllables per line. A specially-designed interface helps users think of words as they write through an interface with external APIs.

A proprietary API contains explanatory information for each poetic form and a randomized example generator allows users to access external links to published examples of each type.

The relational JPA database is designed to maintain user login name, poet name, poem title, and poem. Through the user interface, writers can access their previously saved poems held on the database, edit and re-save them as needed, or delete. 

A Discover page provides users with links to poets, events, definitions of terms, and more.
